The unit-test bundle and app compilation run on the GitHub Actions macOS runner because UIKit/WebKit iOS targets cannot be compiled on Windows. Workflow run `#6` completed successfully for commit `70ad4b2`: the simulator test bundle compiled, the unsigned device IPA was packaged, and the Windows self-hosted runner delivered it to `%MINIBROWSER_DELIVERY_DIRECTORY%\MiniBrowser.ipa`. Local post-delivery checks confirmed a readable ZIP/IPA structure, one `Payload/MiniBrowser.app/Info.plist`, deployment target 26.0, and no code-signature or embedded provisioning entries.

Workflow run `#7` completed successfully for commit `bcad976` and delivered the focus-mode build to the fixed IPA path. The JavaScript dialog issue was resolved and confirmed on device. TargetPage focus mode and the native toolbar sizing changes still require device confirmation.

Workflow run `#8` completed successfully for commit `a8b4b49` and delivered the input-focus zoom build to the fixed IPA path. Local verification found SHA-256 `1E9F5AE160C17543D17EACBF50837132D04FB27FD2375AA9E17AFA479F3C5CCE`, a valid ZIP structure, deployment target 26.0, and no signature or embedded provisioning entries. Manual pinch zoom remains enabled by design; focus behavior requires device confirmation.

Workflow run `#9` completed successfully for commit `9d89209` and delivered the simplified TargetPage layout build to the fixed IPA path. Local verification found SHA-256 `E12B8CB33DF87E3BA6336882A7A91ECA2941EA492802A4E5FC2475CCE088F207`, a valid ZIP structure, deployment target 26.0, and no signature or embedded provisioning entries. Layout, posting, and own-reply visibility require device confirmation.

Workflow run `#10` completed successfully for commit `8fcefe5` and delivered the compact form and official-list split-view build to the fixed IPA path. Local verification found SHA-256 `E2D64E3830EBB919FE6A29B1B1FB7B500485DC30D15A5030C24CCC4803885C35`, a valid `Payload/MiniBrowser.app` ZIP structure, deployment target 26.0, and no signature or embedded provisioning entries. The split layout, sort switching, draft retention, posting, and own-reply visibility require device confirmation. The reusable workflow is subsequently updated to execute XCTest on an automatically selected available iPhone Simulator instead of only compiling the test bundle.

Workflow run `#11` completed successfully for commit `ddf9838`: all XCTest cases ran on an automatically selected iPhone Simulator, the unsigned device IPA was rebuilt, and the Windows self-hosted runner replaced the fixed delivery file. Local verification found SHA-256 `626320098A0DCB5A4DAA2A59D5E26B1A31417E46640B6AFD085F75524FFFDDAA`, deployment target 26.0, a valid `Payload/MiniBrowser.app` structure, and zero signature or embedded-provisioning entries.

An iPhone 14-class device on iOS 26.5.2 then reported an immediate `SIGABRT` in `swift::AsyncTask::completeFuture` / `__cxa_pure_virtual` while opener texts were loading. The four-child throwing task group was removed in favor of one cancellable sequential loader, eliminating the implicated concurrent future-completion path while retaining bounded Range requests and progressive list updates.

Workflow run `#13` completed successfully for crash-fix commit `bd8682c`, including all unit tests and the 20-second list launch UI smoke test. The Windows runner delivered the corrected IPA at 2026-09-05 14:38:23 JST. Local verification found SHA-256 `5660C8E77871CE1AFB6D4189BBFB5B59466C69AD316068A5AB944A6346A48003`, deployment target 26.0, a valid Payload structure, and no signature or embedded-provisioning entries. Final confirmation of the device-specific crash fix requires reinstalling this build on the reporting device.

The crash fix and posting were subsequently confirmed on the reporting device. Issue #1 was closed from that evidence. List thumbnails now use explicit sequential requests with a list Referer, one retry, and an in-memory success cache instead of `AsyncImage`; selected threads receive a persistent open count and highlighted background. The response-mode heading is hidden and the reply/draft buttons sit above the form table so the handwriting field can remain open.

Workflow run `#15` compiled commit `962bac0`, ran 35 unit tests with zero failures, passed the 37-second list launch test, built the unsigned app, and uploaded its IPA. After a 90% GitHub Actions allowance alert, the run was cancelled at the delivery boundary to stop further hosted-runner use; the already-generated artifact was downloaded and delivered locally without another Actions run. Verification found SHA-256 `25AC8ED8EA16795B755C22523F9AA55828847872AD70D1769CA0E7E5E44E8A58`, deployment target 26.0, one expected app payload, and zero signature/provisioning entries. The IPA workflow is now manual-dispatch-only to avoid spending macOS minutes for intermediate pushes. Issue #2 remains open for device confirmation.

The private-repository workflow now cancels duplicate runs for the same ref and limits the hosted macOS build job to 12 minutes. Codex defaults to GPT-5.6 Luna/MAX for routine work, with documented early escalation to Terra/High or Sol/High for progressively higher-risk implementation and diagnosis.
The 19:01 TargetPage form and list change set was reverted after device testing found a regression: the focused thread view showed the full reply list and list cells could not open their threads. Workflow run `#17` and its IPA remain historical delivery evidence only; a new IPA must be built and delivered from the restored baseline before further device testing. Future TargetPage improvements will be isolated into small, independently verifiable changes.

The first isolated follow-up applies only two independent behaviors: the TargetPage deletion key is forced to read-only `2310` when the form loads, changes, or submits; and the app auto-dismisses only the exact `img.targethost.net` Cookie retry alert. Form-position switching and list loading are intentionally unchanged.

The follow-up workflow dispatch for commit `4bdc9ad` failed before any macOS runner step began, so no IPA was generated or delivered. The latest device IPA remains the restored-baseline build. The immediate runner-level failure follows the earlier GitHub Actions allowance warning; its billing detail is not available through the repository credential used for diagnostics.

The repository was made public by explicit user decision after the private-account Actions quota reached 2,000 of 2,000 minutes. Workflow run `#20` then completed successfully for commit `2dc68e8`: XCTest passed on the iPhone Simulator, the unsigned IPA was built and validated, and the Windows runner replaced `%MINIBROWSER_DELIVERY_DIRECTORY%\MiniBrowser.ipa`. SHA-256 is `12B78B12655D9EAAACD8832B2C0AC361F8B32312B7DAEF6DA9F46284B6630A0A`; the archive contains `Payload/MiniBrowser.app`, declares minimum OS 26.0, and has no signature or embedded provisioning entries. Device confirmation of the deletion-key and exact Cookie-alert behavior remains pending.

The reporting iPhone subsequently confirmed the deletion-key and exact Cookie-alert behavior. The next isolated list change raises the active-thread limit from 30 to 60, excludes threads with 1,000 or more replies, preserves matching thumbnail data across refreshes, and rotates failed thumbnail retries so later cells are not indefinitely starved. Windows static checks pass; iOS XCTest and device verification remain pending.
